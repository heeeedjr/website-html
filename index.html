        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up as a military brat so I don't really have a place to call home. 
          I have two younger sisters, one of which is my twin. I am happily married to 
          my beautiful wife of almost two years now. I love sports, but I am focused on
          pickleball at the moment. I am a cybersecurity major and a computer science 
          minor. I will hopefully graduated before the second coming. I really enjoy Web
          Development, but don't think I will make a career out of it. Oh, I'm bald and
          I speak French.

        <h2>Start up project</h2>
        <p>
          I am planning to make a IT Blog. This is a personal project that I have wanted to
          do for some time but never got around to it. It will cover my journey into the IT
          field and all the beautiful scenery as well as the nasty potholes along the way.

        <h2>Simon project</h2>
        <p>
          Simon is a game where the user attempts to mimic the color pattern provided. Each
          successfull input adds one more color to the total length of the patteren. Code for
          this application was given to us. Our job is to experiment with it and make it our
          own. Here is my version of the application.
